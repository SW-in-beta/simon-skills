## Why simon-bot?

Most AI coding assistants generate code and hope for the best. simon-bot treats every task like a production deployment:

- **Ship with confidence** — A 19-step pipeline with mandatory TDD, 5 expert-team reviews, and a success-criteria gate means code is verified before you ever see a PR.
- **Scale without chaos** — Each work unit runs in an isolated git worktree. Parallel execution, zero interference, clean history.
- **Get smarter over time** — Built-in retrospectives feed back into future runs. A dedicated boost skill lets you teach it new tricks from articles, repos, and papers.
- **Stay safe by default** — No force pushes, no real DB access, no destructive commands. Ever.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SW-in-beta/simon-bot.git
cd simon-bot
./install.sh
```

Then in Claude Code:

```
/simon-bot implement user authentication with JWT
```

<summary><strong>Expert Teams (5 domains, 22 specialists)</strong></summary>

Experts operate as **teams that discuss and reach consensus**, not individual reviewers.

| Team | Members | Activation | Focus |
|------|---------|------------|-------|
| **Safety** | appsec, auth, infrasec, stability | Always (appsec + stability) | Security boundaries, auth bypass, failure recovery |
| **Code Design** | convention, idiom, design-pattern, testability | Always (convention + idiom) | Repo conventions, idioms, design patterns, testability |
| **Data** | rdbms, cache, nosql | Auto-detect (min 2) | Data consistency, cache invalidation, cross-storage integrity |
| **Integration** | sync-api, async, external-integration, messaging | Auto-detect (min 2) | Sync/async boundaries, error propagation, failure isolation |
| **Ops** | infra, observability, performance, concurrency | Auto-detect (min 2) | Operational stability, observability, performance |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Configuration (config.yaml)</strong></summary>

Adjust thresholds, loop limits, and expert behavior in `.claude/workflow/config.yaml`:

```yaml
model_policy: opus              # Model for all agents
language: ko                    # Report language

unit_limits:
  max_files: 5
  max_lines: 200

size_thresholds:
  function_lines: 50
  file_lines: 300

loop_limits:
  critic_planner: 3
  step4b_critical: 2
  step7b_recheck: 1
  step7_8: 2
  step6_executor: 3
  step16: 3

expert_panel:
  mode: agent-team
  discussion_rounds: 2
  require_consensus: true

test_env:
  check_before_test: true
  skip_on_missing: true
```

Customize expert review criteria in `.claude/workflow/prompts/*.md` (22 expert prompts).
Past feedback is stored in `.claude/memory/retrospective.md` and automatically referenced in future runs.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>simon-bot-review</strong></summary>

Handles PR creation and code review after work is complete:

- **Draft PR creation** — auto-generates PR based on change analysis
- **Inline code review** — analyzes diff and writes GitHub inline comments
- **CI Watch** — monitors CI pipeline and responds to failures
- **Feedback loop** — applies fixes based on review comments and re-verifies

Uses `review-sequence.md` from simon-bot if available; otherwise performs independent review at the same quality level.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>simon-company</strong></summary>

Builds large-scale full-stack services with multi-team collaboration (PM, Design, Frontend, Backend, QA, DBA, DevOps, ML):

- **Consultation mode** — structures vague ideas through a guided interview
- **Scope Guard** — auto-redirects small projects to simon-bot-pm
- **Full lifecycle** — planning → design → development → QA → deployment → operations
- Explicit invocation only (`/simon-company`)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>simon-presenter</strong></summary>

Runs finished apps with a Playwright headed browser for interactive live demonstrations:

- User-story-based scenarios showcasing core features
- Real browser interaction for behavior verification
- Presentation mode for stakeholder demos

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Boost Family (boost / boost-capture / boost-review)</strong></summary>

**simon-bot-boost** — Reads external resources (blogs, GitHub, papers) and a 5-person expert panel proposes skill improvements. All proposals require explicit approval before application.

**simon-bot-boost-capture** — Records skill improvement insights in the background during active work. Captures ideas without interrupting your workflow for later batch processing.

**simon-bot-boost-review** — Reviews and applies accumulated insights from boost-capture. Batch-processes captured improvement proposals into actual skill changes.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Safety Rules</strong></summary>

The following actions are **absolutely forbidden** at all times:

- `git push --force` — never, under any circumstances
- Merge to `main`/`master` — only PRs
- `rm -rf` — no destructive deletions
- Real DB access — `mysql`, `psql`, `redis-cli`, `mongosh`
- Real API calls — `curl`, `wget` to external endpoints
- Real server access — `ssh`, `scp`, `sftp`
- Secret commits — `.env`, credentials, API keys
- Tests with real external systems — mock/stub only

<summary><strong>Full Workflow Details (19 steps)</strong></summary>

### Phase A: Planning (Interactive)

| Step | What happens |
|------|-------------|
| **0** | Scope challenge — analyze existing code, determine minimum change, select review path (SMALL / STANDARD / LARGE) |
| **1-A** | Project analysis + Code Design Team pre-analysis (conventions, patterns, idioms) |
| **1-B** | Interview mode — break work into units, build plan |
| **2** | Critic-planner discussion (up to 3 rounds) |
| **3** | Meta-verification of critic's review |
| **4** | Over-engineering check (YAGNI/KISS) |
| **4-B** | All 5 expert teams review the plan, flag concerns |

### Phase B-E: Implementation & Verification (Autonomous)

Each unit runs in an isolated git worktree with mandatory TDD (RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR).

| Step | What happens |
|------|-------------|
| **5** | Implementation with TDD |
| **6** | Purpose alignment review |
| **7-A** | 5 expert teams verify against real diff |
| **7-B** | Cross-check against Step 4-B concerns |
| **8** | Regression verification |
| **9** | File/function splitting |
| **10** | Integration/reuse review |
| **11** | Side effect check |
| **12** | Full change review |
| **13** | Dead code cleanup |
| **14** | Code quality assessment |
| **15** | Flow verification (backend/data/error/event) |
| **16** | MEDIUM issue resolution |
| **17** | Production readiness + success criteria gate |

### Finalization

| Step | What happens |
|------|-------------|
| **Integration** | Commit, resolve conflicts, build/test verification |
| **18** | Work report (before/after flows, trade-offs, risks) |
| **18-B** | Group changes into logical review units |
| **19** | Interactive guided review, success criteria verification, PR creation |
