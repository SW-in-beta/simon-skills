## Why simon?

Most AI coding assistants generate code and hope for the best. simon treats every task like a production deployment:

- **Ship with confidence** — A 19-step pipeline with mandatory TDD, 5 expert-team reviews, and a success-criteria gate means code is verified before you ever see a PR.
- **Scale without chaos** — Each work unit runs in an isolated git worktree. Parallel execution, zero interference, clean history.
- **Get smarter over time** — Built-in retrospectives feed back into future runs. A dedicated boost skill lets you teach it new tricks from articles, repos, and papers.
- **Stay safe by default** — No force pushes, no real DB access, no destructive commands. Ever.
- **Never lose your place** — State-Driven Execution restores the exact step position from workflow-state.json on every turn, surviving compaction and session resumption.
- **Self-correcting against rationalization** — Anti-Rationalization Tables and Red Flags structurally detect shortcuts (skipped steps, arbitrary interpretation, unverified progress) before they cause rework.

## Agent Strategy

Reliability is the top priority -- token usage and cost are irrelevant compared to result accuracy.

| Pattern | When to use | Core principle |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| **Agent Team** (shared context) | Agents with different perspectives discuss toward a shared goal | Six Thinking Hats -- each agent argues from a distinct viewpoint to reach better conclusions |
| **SubAgent** (isolated context) | Independent analyses converge to increase confidence | Monte Carlo -- convergence of independent trials provides higher confidence than any single analysis |

**Decision rule**: "Would agents produce better results by seeing each other's output?"
- **YES** -- Agent Team (discussion value > independence loss) -- best for planning, design debates
- **NO** -- SubAgent (independence value > discussion absence) -- best for verification, audits, parallel execution

> In verification/audit steps, opinion exchange via Agent Team's messaging becomes a pathway for confirmation bias. Steps where verification is the goal use SubAgents to structurally guarantee independence.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>simon-code-review</strong></summary>

Handles PR creation and code review after work is complete:

- **Draft PR creation** — auto-generates PR based on change analysis with Review Guide section
- **Blind-First 2-Pass review** — analyzes diff independently before consulting review-sequence.md to avoid anchoring bias. Independent severity assessment with `[SEVERITY-DISPUTED]` tagging when assessments diverge
- **Existing pattern scan** — proactively searches the codebase for existing alternatives to newly introduced patterns
- **Official docs verification** — fact-checks used APIs/patterns against official docs (context7 MCP, WebSearch) to pre-identify deprecated APIs and anti-patterns
- **Impact analysis pass** — identifies unchanged code that may be affected by changes (1-depth caller/consumer search)
- **Architecture Impact** — Review Summary includes architecture impact analysis covering dependency direction, module boundaries, extensibility, and data flow (STANDARD+ path)
- **Large PR handling** — 100+ file PRs classified as Core/Support/Generated, 80% focus on core files
- **CI Watch** — delegates CI monitoring + auto-fix to simon-ci-fix (error classification, diagnosis, fix, push — up to 5 cycles)
- **Comment Auto-Watch** — polls PR comments every minute, auto-applies new feedback
- **Expert-verified feedback loop** — spawns domain expert Agents to verify user comments before acting (AGREE/PARTIAL/COUNTER verdict with Self-Agreement Bias mitigation)
- **Interruption recovery protocol** — auto-resumes remaining workflow after push failures, API errors, etc. Prevents inline review omission
- **Feedback loop** — code fix → commit → inline review rewrite → CI re-check

In STANDALONE mode, 3 Agent Teams (architect, writer, impact-analyzer) run parallel analysis to self-generate the review-sequence.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>simon-company</strong></summary>

Builds large-scale full-stack services with multi-team collaboration (PM, Design, Frontend, Backend, QA, DBA, DevOps, ML):

- **Consultation mode** — structures vague ideas through a guided interview
- **Scope Guard** — auto-redirects small projects to simon-pm
- **Full lifecycle** — planning → design → development → QA → deployment → operations
- Explicit invocation only (`/simon-company`)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>simon-presenter</strong></summary>

Runs finished apps with a Playwright headed browser for interactive live demonstrations:

- User-story-based scenarios showcasing core features
- Real browser interaction for behavior verification
- Presentation mode for stakeholder demos

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Boost Family (auto-boost / boost / boost-capture / boost-review)</strong></summary>

**simon-auto-boost** — Automatically searches Claude Code docs, Hacker News, Medium, YouTube and more for the latest AI coding agent best practices. A 6-person expert panel analyzes findings, proposes improvements with user approval, then verifies against skill writing guidelines and runs smoke tests. Tracks last search timestamp to only process new content.

**simon-boost** — Reads external resources (blogs, GitHub, papers) and a 6-person expert panel proposes skill improvements. All proposals require explicit approval before application.

**simon-boost-capture** — Records skill improvement insights in the background during active work. Captures ideas without interrupting your workflow for later batch processing.

**simon-boost-review** — Reviews and applies accumulated insights from boost-capture. Batch-processes captured improvement proposals into actual skill changes.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>simon-web-search</strong></summary>

Deep research skill for technical topics. Goes beyond simple search:

- **Question decomposition** — breaks the main question into 3-8 sub-topics before searching
- **Multi-pass parallel search** — Round 1 broad search, Round 2 gap detection, Round 3+ focused verification (deep mode)
- **Source triangulation** — cross-validates claims across independent sources. Single-source claims are marked `[UNVERIFIED]`
- **Source chain verification** — tracks 2nd-hand citations back to primary sources (no "A says B said C" without verifying C)
- **Confidence ratings** — every factual claim tagged with source URL and HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW confidence
- **Depth modes** — quick (1 round, ~1-2 min), standard (2-3 rounds, ~3-5 min), deep (3-5 rounds, ~7-15 min)
- **Report viewer integration** — generates a structured Markdown report and optionally renders it as HTML

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>simon-ci-fix</strong></summary>

Auto-fixes CI failures on PRs with specialized recovery strategies per error type:

- **Up to 5 fix cycles** — log analysis, error classification, code fix, push, re-check
- **Error-type routing** — different strategies for lint, test, build, type-check failures
- **Dual mode** — auto-invoked by simon-code-review's CI Watch, or run standalone
- **Smart diagnosis** — analyzes CI logs to identify root cause before attempting fixes

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Anti-Rationalization & Red Flags</strong></summary>

Two structural mechanisms that keep the workflow on track:

**Anti-Rationalization Tables** — Each Phase A/B step lists common rationalizations and why they fail.

| Rationalization | Reality |
|----------------|---------|
| "The spec is clear, skip Step 0" | Scope Challenge determines SMALL/STANDARD/LARGE. Skipping causes over-engineering or missed validation |
| "Simple implementation, write code first, tests later" | Code without tests becomes an instant CRITICAL issue at Step 7 Expert Review |
| "I've built something similar, don't need reuse review" | Duplicate implementations found at Step 10 require rework |

**Red Flags** — If you see these, the workflow is not executing correctly:

- 3+ Steps progressed without updating `workflow-state.json`
- Quietly modifying files not in the plan
- Logging "will write tests later"
- Skipping Step 6 Purpose Alignment as "obviously passing"
- Proceeding to next step after a CRITICAL expert finding
- **Spec conflicts with existing code — proceeding with arbitrary interpretation instead of Confusion Management**

**Confusion Management Protocol** — When spec, code, or requirements conflict, stop and explicitly name the confusion point with options before proceeding.

**Post-Implementation Simplicity Check** — After implementation, detect and remove unnecessary complexity (over-abstraction, unused design slack, code duplication).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Safety Rules</strong></summary>

The following actions are **absolutely forbidden** at all times:

- `git push --force` — never, under any circumstances
- Merge to `main`/`master` — only PRs
- `rm -rf` — no destructive deletions
- Real DB access — `mysql`, `psql`, `redis-cli`, `mongosh`
- Real API calls — `curl`, `wget` to external endpoints
- Real server access — `ssh`, `scp`, `sftp`
- Secret commits — `.env`, credentials, API keys
- Tests with real external systems — mock/stub only

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Full Workflow Details (19 steps)</strong></summary>

### Phase A: Planning (Interactive)

| Step | What happens |
|------|-------------|
| **0** | Scope challenge — analyze existing code, determine minimum change, select review path (SMALL / STANDARD / LARGE) |
| **1-A** | Project analysis + Code Design Team pre-analysis (conventions, patterns, idioms) |
| **1-B** | Interview mode — break work into units, build plan |
| **2** | Critic-planner discussion (up to 3 rounds) |
| **3** | Meta-verification of critic's review |
| **4** | Over-engineering check (YAGNI/KISS) |
| **4-B** | All 5 expert teams review the plan, flag concerns |

### Phase B-E: Implementation & Verification (Autonomous)

Each unit runs in an isolated git worktree with mandatory TDD (RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR).

| Step | What happens |
|------|-------------|
| **5** | Implementation with TDD |
| **6** | Purpose alignment review |
| **7-A** | 5 expert teams verify against real diff |
| **7-B** | Cross-check against Step 4-B concerns |
| **8** | Regression verification |
| **9** | File/function splitting |
| **10** | Integration/reuse review |
| **11** | Side effect check |
| **12** | Full change review |
| **13** | Dead code cleanup |
| **14** | Code quality assessment |
| **15** | Flow verification (backend/data/error/event) |
| **16** | MEDIUM issue resolution |
| **17** | Production readiness + success criteria gate |

### Finalization

| Step | What happens |
|------|-------------|
| **Integration** | Commit, resolve conflicts, build/test verification |
| **18** | Work report (before/after flows, trade-offs, risks) |
| **18-B** | Group changes into logical review units |
| **19** | Interactive guided review, success criteria verification, PR creation |
